# Final Project...

## Stack
### Frontend
* React/Redux
* Apollo Client/GraphQL
* Webpack
* SCSS

### Backend
* Apollo Server /w Express
* GraphQL Subscriptions
* MongoDB

## Order of Execution

<!-- ### Step 1 -->
<!-- * Set up Apollo Server and some resolvers, typeDefs on the backend, start the server! 
* Set up Apollo Client with React & Redux on the frontend, do some testing
* Try out subscriptions with Apollo Server, some easy thing on the front end, f.e a blinking light  -->

### Step 2
* Grid sending events through GraphQL. 
* Hardcode some ships to test against. 
* Two hardcoded users and a gameboard on init
* Implement core game logic
* Set up MongoDB within the resolvers. 

## Step 3
* Random places for assests, so no logic on frontend is required for placing.  
* Implement functionality for creating new games
* Implement Express endpoints for games using params
* Sign-up feature for users, implement authentication (hashing algorithm)
* Implement simpel user page

## Step 4 
* Graphics/design/visuals
* More tests
* ...
